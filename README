This is a library for RMON.
As it is library, there are a lot of callback functions have been used, which
need to be initialized in the application code.

In this library, I have used below callbacks, so when porting please initialize them properly.
    1. void *(* rmon_alloc_memory)(int);
    2. void (* rmon_free_memory)(int, void *);
    3. void (* rmon_timer_create)(int, int, rmon_timer_cb, void *);
    4. void (* rmon_timer_delete)(int);
    5. int (* rmon_get_sys_uptime)();
    6. void (* do_rmon_trace)(int, int, char *, ...);
 
In my APP, I did initialized as below:

    rmon_alloc_memory = fn_rmon_alloc_memory;
    rmon_free_memory  = fn_rmon_free_memory;

    rmon_timer_create = fn_rmon_timer_create;
    rmon_timer_delete = fn_rmon_timer_delete;

    rmon_get_sys_uptime = fn_rmon_get_sys_uptime;
    do_rmon_trace = fn_do_rmon_trace;

Some definitions can be found in rmon_disp.c, fill up with your own handler. 
This file must be part of your main RMON Application.

Hope this clarifies.
